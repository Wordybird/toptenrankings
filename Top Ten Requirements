Your task is to revise what we've done today by creating Java classes and testing them in Android Studio. What we'd like you to do is, using TDD, implement a couple of classes to maintain a list of the top 10 dart players in the world. You will need to create two classes (and tests), one for a player, the other for maintaining the rankings.

A player will have the following attributes:

* Name
* Nickname
* Current Ranking

You should be able to perform the following methods on a player:

* Get/Set Name
* Get/Set Nickname
* Get/Set Ranking
* Override the default toString() method so that it returns a string containing the player's details e.g. "Name: Phil Taylor, Nickname: 'The Power', Ranking: 1"

The rankings will contain an array of Player objects. Each player's position in the array will correspond to their current ranking e.g. the player with ranking 2 will be at index 1 in the array

You should be able to perform the following methods on the rankings list:

* Get the player with a specified ranking
* Replace the player at the end of the list with a new one

REMEMBER - to write tests

##Extensions

If you want to, and have time, you can implement the following methods:

* Find a specific player in the list by their name
* Move a player up/down one place in the rankings
 * NOTE - doing this will also need to update the player's ranking
